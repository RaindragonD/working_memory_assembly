# MemSet: a Neural Algorithm on the Interaction between Working Memory and Long-Term Memory

In this repository, we implement an algorithm that stimulates the interaction between working memory and long-term memory. The code is based upon [assembly calculus](https://github.com/dmitropolsky/assemblies).
